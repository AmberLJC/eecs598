# EECS598 Assignment3: Surveying the Landscape

### *Know in-depth about the state-of-the-art on one topic of your pick*
##

### Due: Apr 26, 2019, 11:59 PM

## Overview
Throughout the semester, we have scratched the surfaces of many topics in the context of big data and AI systems and applications. 
In this assignment, your job is to take a deep dive into one of these topics to better understand the state-of-the-art beyond the few papers we have covered in the class and then summarizing your findings so that everyone else can learn from it.

For example, we primarily talked about Chameleon and Focus in terms of video analytics; however, there are many other solutions that we couldn't possibly cover. 
A survey on video analytics would identify the key works on this topic, recognize how they influence each other or contradict each other, highlight the key assumptions and insights, and finally, *create a taxonomy* of the relevant pieces of work.

Unlike other assignments, this assignment is very open-ended without any specific tasks, which can be both easier or more difficult depending on how much time you put into it.

## Learning Outcomes
After completing this assignment, students should be able to:

* Identify the key assumptions and insights on their topic of choice.
* Be able to capture the gist of a large area in succinctly written form.

## Topics
You can decide to survey any relevant area of your choice in the context of big data systems and/or applications.
Possible topics could be the headings of our schedule or based on certain themes, such as

* Systems for AI
* AI for Systems
* Machine Learning Systems
* Deep Learning Systems
* Big Data Infrastructure
* Resource Management and Scheduling
* Programming Frameworks and Execution Engines
* Query Processing
* Streaming Analytics
* Graph Processing
* RDMA-Enabled Systems

## Before You Start
Before you start, however, **you must email your group members, two possible topics (we'll try to pick one of the two), and three representative papers on each topic to `eecs598-bigdata-staff@umich.edu` by Apr 5 and receive a confirmation.**
These three representative papers should represent the topic and direction of your survey.
To do a great job on this assignment, you are expected to find more than three papers as your reference (10 or above could be a good indication of efforts).

## Presentation
Every group will have to do a 5-minute or less **in-class presentation on April 22** addressing the following:

* What is the survey topic?
* What are the key categories and example systems in those categories?
* What criteria did you use to categorize?

## Survey Structure
At a high level, your survey should have the following sections.

* Introduction: 
    * Provides a clear description of the area. What is it a subset of? What is the current status? Avoid boilerplate (e.g., X has seen significant attention in recent years ...).
    * Include a short history/background. What key event/paper/work resulted in this area? What area led to this new area of research?
* Terminology:
    * Introduce the key terminology of the area. Pay special attention to terms (if any) that have a unique meaning to this area of works.
    * A reader should not be confused about any terminology of the survey after reading this section, and they should be able to refer back to it even if they get confused.
* Foundational Concepts and Design Goals:
    * What are the key concepts and assumptions of this area?
    * What are the design goals? What must a new system satisfy to be considered a part of this area of research?
* Taxonomy:
    * Based on the prior section, you should be able to put existing works into categories. Include a short description of the key systems/papers.
    * Include a table where each column is a category and each row is a system/paper.
    * Include a column on the availability of the source code, adding a link to the code if it is available.
* Key Reserch Directions:
    * What challenges do you think (or the papers you have surveyed) point out as future directions of research?
    * What are the future trends? Where is this field going?
* Conclusion:
    * Summarize your findings. Highlight challenges that you think are the most pressing. Mention whether you think if this area is ramping up or ramping down. A sign for the latter would be too many papers with small/incremental tweaks.

## Submission Instructions
You are going to email a 6-page two-column PDF on 10-pt font to `eecs598-bigdata-staff@umich.edu`.
The page limit does not include the references.
